Prior to joining, I was averaging 60-70% with a 60% mark in year 11 preliminary economics exam. Through hard work and the diligent effort that A1 sustains with every student, I was able to turn these marks around. Through this tuition, I was effectively able to increase my marks with a 94% and 96% in term 3 and HSC economics trials, respectively. I highly recommend A1 education to all who want to succeed in economics."';
